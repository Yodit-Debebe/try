## 🗄️ Database Design

### Key Entities

- **Users**
  - `id`: Primary key  
  - `name`: Full name  
  - `email`: Unique email address  
  - `password`: Hashed password  
  - `role`: User role (guest/host/admin)  

- **Properties**
  - `id`: Primary key  
  - `user_id`: Foreign key → Users (host who owns the property)  
  - `title`: Property title  
  - `description`: Property details  
  - `price_per_night`: Price of booking  

- **Bookings**
  - `id`: Primary key  
  - `user_id`: Foreign key → Users (guest who booked)  
  - `property_id`: Foreign key → Properties  
  - `check_in`: Start date  
  - `check_out`: End date  

- **Payments**
  - `id`: Primary key  
  - `booking_id`: Foreign key → Bookings  
  - `amount`: Payment amount  
  - `status`: Payment status (pending/completed)  
  - `transaction_date`: Date of payment  

- **Reviews**

## 🔒 API Security

### Key Security Measures
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login to secure user access.  
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (guest, host, admin).  
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse by limiting requests.  
- **Data Encryption**: Store passwords hashed, secure payment details.  
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.  

### Why Security Matters
- **User Data Protection**: Safeguards personal details (emails, passwords).  
- **Payment Security**: Ensures financial transactions are secure.  
- **System Integrity**: Prevents malicious access and abuse.  
- **Fair Access**: Rate limiting stops bots and DDoS attacks.

## ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates **testing, building, and deployment** of the backend. It ensures faster delivery and fewer bugs.  

### Importance
- Automatic testing on every code change.  
- Faster deployments with minimal downtime.  
- Consistent environments using Docker.  
- Early detection of bugs.  

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate builds, tests, deployments.  
- **Docker**: Containerize the backend for consistent environments.  
- **PostgreSQL in Docker**: Run database in pipelines.  
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean**: Deployment platforms.
